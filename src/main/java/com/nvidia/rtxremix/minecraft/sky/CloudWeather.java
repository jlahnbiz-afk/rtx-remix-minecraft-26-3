/**
 * The weather the Unbound clouds show, which changes from day to day and around the rain: how
 * much of the sky each layer covers, and how calm the day is. Every layer keeps the share of
 * the Cloud Coverage setting it has always had, and each day's two moods, which turn into the
 * next day's overnight, move it a little either way: how unstable the air is grows the
 * cumulus, and how moist it is spreads the large cumulus and the altostratus. Before the rain the large cumulus thicken and the
 * altostratus draws over; after it broken cumulus linger while the sheet has gone.
 *
 * <p>The day and the hour come from the world's clock, so every player sees the same sky.
 * Only the integrated server can say when the rain will come, so the sky closes ahead of it in
 * single-player alone; the clearing after it runs from when this client saw the rain end. A
 * clear spell set by command shows neither. Render thread only; it reads the integrated
 * server's weather timers without a lock, which only ever lags them by a tick.
